> A modified version of the SlimeVR case made to fit a 4pin JST connector for AUX trackers

## Notes

- This is untested for now, I still need parts to arrive for actual tests. Everything *should* work, as it is simply the [Hyperion case](https://github.com/Smeltie/Hyperion) and the PCB tray from Lupinixx's [Modified case](https://github.com/Lupinixx/SlimeVR-Hyperion-BMI160-PCB). If you're going to print this off and this message is still here, please be aware things may not fit amazingly together.
- When I verify everything is working, I will add images to this readme.

## Acknowledgements and References

I am NOT good at modelling or anything, this is my first experience using CAD and 3d software, so if there are any errors with the models, please let me know (if you have the capabilities, and would want to fix anything, please do so; I will keep updated on pull requests).


I am using this myself, if something doesn't work, I will fix it until I am happy with it.
